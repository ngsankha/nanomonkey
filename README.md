# Nanomonkey

A JavaScript to JavaScript experimental compiler.

The Spec is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/sankha93/nanomonkey/wiki/Spec).

---

The aim of this compiler is to take annotated JavaScript source and then output JavaScript. The role of this compiler will be to help developers catch bugs, both by detecting bugs during compilation and by inserting runtime checks that will be executed only in debug mode.

It can be used to add type-safety checks in a dynamic language like JavaScript.

Example Input:

```javascript
/**
 * @precondition {y != 0}
 */
function divide(x, y) {
  return x / y;
}
```

Corresponding output:

```javascript
function divide(x, y) {
  if (!(y != 0)) {
    throw new Error("Precondition failed: (y != 0)"); 
  }
  return x / y;
}
```

Original idea inspired from a [Mozilla student project](https://github.com/Yoric/Mozilla-Student-Projects/issues/40).

## Why Nanomonkey?

Because nano is an anagram of anno, and Nanomonkey works on annotated JavaScript.
